why is the mesh controller sending a broadcast message?

change code such that the nodes send data only to the gateway nodes.
After the above implementation we'll have to put dummy nodes throughout the
campus.

Add a oled display to the mesh_controller to display node_id required to
send data directly to this controller and to display ip in case of 
config mode.


change pins to use gpios to send data to gateway instead of rx tx
